UUP dump standalone
-------------------

### Description
This code is used by backend server of UUP dump website to automatically
retrieve new builds and automatically generate packs used to create proper
UUP sets.

### Why the code is being publisned now?
Before now the UUP dump website was internally using the UUP dump UUPDL edition
which was a rebrand of UUP dump 2.x series which was meant for console only
purposes and distributed only with UUPDL. Now I have decided to rebrand this
for the third time and publish it as MIT licensed project. This will allow me
easier updates to the backend in much more transparent way.
